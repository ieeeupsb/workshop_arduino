# Musical Genius

To demonstrate that the Arduino can doo literally everything, we decided to (probably the worst decision of our lives) give all the participants a buzzer! Yay... My ears are going to not suffer at all.

## The 'Tone' Library.

> Only one tone can be generated at a time. If a tone is already playing on a different pin, the call to tone() will have no effect. If the tone is playing on the same pin, the call will set its frequency.

> Use of the tone() function will interfere with PWM output on pins 3 and 11 (on boards other than the Mega).

This is the circuit we'll use for this exercise:
