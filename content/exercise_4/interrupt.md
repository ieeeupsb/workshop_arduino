# Exercise 4 - Interrupts

Interrupts are crucial when dealing with external inputs that are unpredictable, such as a button press triggered by a person.

Create a program that triggers an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) whenever a button is pressed. The ISR must increment a counter, and the Arduino must print the counter's value every second.
