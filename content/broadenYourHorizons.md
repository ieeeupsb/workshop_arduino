# Broaden Your Horizons

Now that you already know how to do some basic things with the arduino, it's time for you to get to know tools that will give you more power and will help you become an embedded systems ninja programmer.

## The Arduino IDE
This is what we were using today and altough it is pretty quick to set up, easy to use, there are some disadvantages that will make you want to use other plataform sooner or later.
First, it's very easy to use. While this is good to get your code up and running quick, it abstracts a lot of things that are important in embedded systems programming.
Also, the Arduino libraries are not very efficient in certain parts and waste RAM and CPU cycles. Overall, the Arduino IDE is not a very good code editor ( very limited debugging and it lacks some text editing features). Lets get to know more tools!

## I like the Arduino libraries but the IDE sucks
[PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/), that's what you will want to use. Built on top of Github's Atom, it supports the Arduino libraries and much more. You will get intelligent code completion, more debugging features and more. It is cross-platform, so it runs on all major operating systems. Make sure to check this out, this open-source project sure deserves attention.
